## **Bugs and Issues**

#### **Gallery Images Not Enlarging on Click**

- Description: The gallery images were not enlarging when clicked, as expected from the Bootstrap template. The issue was resolved by replacing the CDN links and specifying the path to the "gallery.js" file.

- Cause: The problem stemmed from the incorrect CDN links and the missing path reference for the "gallery.js" file.

- Resolution: To address this issue, I replaced the faulty CDN links with the correct ones and provided the proper path to the "gallery.js" file. After making these changes, the gallery images started enlarging upon clicking, matching the expected behavior.


#### **Missing Close Button in Mobile Gallery**

- Description: On occasion, the close button for closing files disappeared in the gallery when accessed on mobile devices. Unfortunately, due to limited experience and time constraints, I couldn't determine the exact cause of this issue.

- Cause: The cause of the missing close button on mobile devices was not identified due to time and expertise limitations.

- Resolution: As of now, further investigation is needed to pinpoint the root cause and implement a solution to ensure that the close button consistently appears in the mobile gallery view.


#### **Issue with Deleting Booking Using "Delete Booking" Button**

- Description: Clicking the "Delete booking" button on the booking page appeared to work as expected, redirecting users to the success page. However, in reality, the booking record was not removed from the user's account. To resolve this issue, I replaced the <a></a> tag with a <form> element using the "POST" method.

- Cause: The issue was related to the use of the <a></a> tag for the "Delete booking" button, which does not send data to the server, leading to the absence of actual record deletion.

- Resolution: To address this problem, I re-implemented the "Delete booking" button by replacing it with a <form> element that uses the "POST" method and includes the necessary parameters for correct deletion. This change ensures that the booking record is successfully deleted from the user's account on the server side. Now, when users click the "Delete booking" button, the record is properly removed, and they receive a confirmation of the deletion.
